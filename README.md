# random-int-api

This very simple Node app returns a JSON with just a random value beween -100 and +100.

Like:
```
{ 
    value: -12
} 
```

This API is [running on Heroku](https://sleepy-bastion-57253.herokuapp.com/) to serve the external fetch in my [react-redux-demo repo](https://github.com/roelver/react-redux-demo).
